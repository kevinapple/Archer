This concise cheatsheet will give you an overview on how to setup your development environment as a web developer. It was created for MacOS developers. However, you can substitute the instructions and tools for Windows and Linux as well. So don't give up yet if you are not a MacOS user. After all, setting up your development environment all by yourself is your first challenge as a striving web developer these days. So let's get started!

The following short checklist reflects my own development environment as being a developer who operates on MacOS. There are different philosophies to shape your development setup. Whereas there are people who prefer to have everything in one IDE, there are also people who use several lightweight tools (e.g. editor, command line) but combine them for their purposes. Personally, I follow the latter philosophy. That's why you will find a bunch of lightweight tools in the following list. However, if you want to have a more thorough guide on how to setup your machine with a sophisticated IDE, head over to these guides. They are dedicated for a React setup, but you can simply leave out React.js from the equation and you have an up and running IDE after following one of these guides. Still, the list below might offer you a couple of useful tools to complement your IDE as well.

1. Git and Github.
2. Visual Studio Code Editor.
3. Node and Npm AND.

That are all the things you need for a development environment. Cask is used on top of Homebrew to install GUI applications such as Chrome, iTerm2 and Sublime. Then there is the editor and the command line which should be selected carefully, because you will spend most of your time as being a developer with them. If you are a JavaScript developer, there is no way around node and npm and thus you should install them with nvm to manage multiple node versions. Last but not least, git and GitHub should be used to manage your projects. If you are just starting out with web development, you should build a presentable portfolio on GitHub to showcase it. I am curious what you are going to code as your first projects. You can share them on GitHub with me or in the comments of this article.
