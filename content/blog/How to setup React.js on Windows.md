Since you are going to use JavaScript for your React development on Windows, there is no way around Node.js and NPM. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime which makes it possible to run JavaScript outside of the browser. The underlying node package manager (NPM) is used to install libraries, such as React.js, to your project on the command line. You will see later on how this works out on the command line for Windows users.

In order to install Node.js for Windows, you need to head over to the Node.js website and download the Windows version which is recommended for most users. Afterward, you should install it. NPM comes automatically with Node.js.

> Note: An alternative way to install and manage Node.js on your Windows machine is nvm-windows. If you are just getting started with web development, I wouldn't recommend it in the beginning. But it can be a powerful asset later on. nvm-windows is the equivalent to the popular nvm package for Unix systems. It's called Node Version Manager. It helps you to upgrade Node.js version and to manage multiple Node.js versions on your PC. I didn't try it myself yet, but I hope it just works similar to the MacOS version.

There are plenty of editors and IDEs out there to develop web applications. Depending on your personal, project or company requirements, you can choose from a range of lightweight editors to full-blown IDEs. Visual Studio Code is a solution in between. Many developers, operating on Windows but also MacOS, enjoy using it. That's why my recommendation would be Visual Studio Code to start developing React applications on Windows. The installation on a Windows machine is simple: Navigate to the official Visual Studio Code website and download the recent version of VS Code in 32 or 64 bit. Afterward, install it and check if everything is working when you open it. That's it for the installation of an editor/IDE on your machine.

If you want to use another editor/IDE, it is up to you. But keep in mind that a couple of the following steps are building up on top of Visual Studio Code. However, it should be possible to substitute these steps for your own editor/IDE.

At some point, you might want to share your projects on GitHub or collaborate with other people via the git version control. If you want to use GitHub as your platform of choice, you should create an account via their official website. GitHub is a social platform where you can follow other people (you could have your first social interaction with me), like (star) their projects or collaborate on open source projects with other people.
