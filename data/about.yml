title   : Why I am Different
description: >
  I am a software and web engineer dedicated to learning and using JavaScript for client-server architectures. After engaging in many projects, I gained experience from the startup world, where I used JavaScript intensively during both my professional life and spare time. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Eventually it led me to talk with others about these topics and to offer help and on-site consulting for companies. I am happy to welcome you on my website :-)

  <br>
  I worked in a full-time position as software engineer in a large Company using JavaScript and other programming language to help thousands of customers to servuce a feedback culture in our products. Those years gave me a lot of practical experiences in the field and I tried to convey a part of the information on my blog.
